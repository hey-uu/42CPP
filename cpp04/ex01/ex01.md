# Exercise 01: I don't want to set the world on fire

## subject

Constructors and destructors of each class must display specific messages.  

Implement a **Brain** class.  
It contains an array of 100 **std::string** called **ideas**.  
This way, Dog and Cat will have a private **Brain*** attribute.  

In your main function, create and fill an array of **Animal** objects.  
Half of it will be **Dog** objects and the other half will be **Cat** objects.  
At the end of your program execution, loop over this array and delete every Animal.  
You must delete directly dogs and cats as Animals.  
The appropraite destructors must be called in the expected order.  


Don't forget to check for **memory leaks**.  

A copy of a Dog or a Cat mustn't be shallow.  
Thus you have to test that your copies are deep copies!
