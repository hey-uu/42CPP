# Ex00: Mommy, when I grow up, I want to be a bureaucrat!

* bureaucrat : 관료

## Subject

Let's design an artificial nightmare of offices, corridors(복도), forms, and waiting queues.  
Sounds fun?  No? Too bad.  

First, start by the smallest cog(톱니) in this vast breaucratic machine: the **Bureaucrat**  

A **Bureaucrat** must have:
- A constant name  
- A grade that ranges from 1(highest possible grade) to 150(lowest possible grade)  

Any attempt to instantiate a Bureaucrat using an invalid grade must throw an exception:  
either a **Bureaucrat::GradeTooHighException** or a **Bureacrat::GradeTooLowException**  

You will provide getters for both these attributes: getName() and getGrade().  
Implement also two member functions to increment or decrement the bureaucrat grade.  
If the grade is out of range, both of them will throw the same exceptions as the constructor.  

!!!
Remember. Since grade 1 is the highest one and 150 the lowest, incrementing a grade 3 should give a grade 2 to the bureaucrat. 
!!!

The thrown exceptions must be catchable using try and catch blocks:

```c++
try 
{
  /* do some stuff with bureaucrats */
}
catch (std::exception &e)
{
  /* handle exception */
}
```

You will implement an overload of the insertion (<<) operator to print something like (without the angle brackets):  

<name>, bureaucrat grade <grade>  

As usual, turn in some tests to prove everything works as expected.
