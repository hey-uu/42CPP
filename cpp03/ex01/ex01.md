## Subject


Because you can never have enough ClapTraps,you will now create a derived robot.
It will be named ScavTrap and will inherit the consturctors and destructor from ClapTrap.
However, its constructors, desstructor andd attack() will print different messages.
 
After all, ClapTraps are aware of their individuality. --> individuality...?
Note that proper construction/destruction chaining must be shown in your tests.
When a ScavTrap is created, the program starts by building a ClapTrap.
Destruction is in reverse order. Why?

**ScavTrap** will use the attributes of ClapTrap (update ClapTrap in consequence)
and must initialize them to :


- Name : it is passed as parameter to a constructor
- Hit Points (100) : represents the health of the ClapTrap
- Energy Points (50)
- Attack Damage (20)

ScavTrap will also have its own special capacity:
	void guardGate();

This member function will display a message informing that ScavTrap is now in Gate keeper mode.

Don't forget to add more tests to your program!!
