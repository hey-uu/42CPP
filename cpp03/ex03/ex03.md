# CPP03_EX03: Now it's weird!

## Subject

In this exercise, you will create a monster:
a ClapTrap that's half FragTrap, half ScavTrap.
It will be named DiamondTrap, and it will inherit from both the FragTrap AND the ScavTrap.
This is so risky!


The DiamondTrap class will have a name private attribute.
Give to this attribute exactly the same variable's name 
(not talking about the robot's name here)
than the one in the ClapTrap base class.

To be more clear, here are two examples.
If ClapTrap's variable is "name", give the "name" to the one of the DiamondTrap.
If ClapTrap's variable is "_name", give the "_name" to the one of the DiamondTrap.

Its attributes and member functions will be picked from either one of its parent classes:

- Name, which is passed as a parameter to a constructor.
- ClapTrap::name (parameter of the constructor + "_clap_name" suffix)
- Hit points(FragTrap)
- Energy points(ScavTrap)
- Attack damage(FragTrap)
- attack() (ScavTrap)

In addition to the special functions of both its parent classes, DiamondTrap will have its own special capacity:
	void whoAmI();
This member function will display both its name and its ClapTrap name.

Of course, the ClapTrap subobject of the DiamondTrap will be created once, and only once.
Yes, there's a trick.

Again, add more tests to your program.

Do you know the -Wshadow and -Wno-shadow compiler flags?
