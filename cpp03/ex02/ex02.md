## Subject


Making ClapTraps is probably starting to get on your nerves.

Now, implement a FragTrap class that inherits from ClapTrap.
It is very similar to ScavTrap.
However, its construction and destruction messages must be different.
Proper construction/destruction chaining must be shown in your tests.
When a FragTrap is created, the program starts by building a ClapTrap.
Destruction is in reverse order.

Same thing for the attributes, but with the different values this time:

- Name, which is passed as parameter to a constructor
- Hit points(100), represent the health of the ClapTrap
- Energy points(100)
- Attack damage(30)

FragTrap has a special capacity too:
	void highFiveGuys(void);

This member function displays a positive high fives request on the standard output.

Again, add more tests to your program.
