# CPP03_EX00: Aaaaand... OPEN!

## Subject

First, you have to implement a class! How original!
It will be called ClapTrap and will have the following private attributes 
initialized to the values specified in brackets:

- Name, which is passed as a parameter to a constructor
- Hit Points(10), represent the health of the ClapTrap
- Energy Points(10)
- Attack Damage(0)

Add the following public member functions so the ClapTrap looks more realistic:
- void attack(const std::string &target);
- void takeDamage(unsigned int amount);
- void beRepaired(unsigned int amount);

When ClapTrap attacks, it cuases its target to lose "attack damage" hit points.
When ClapTrap repairs itself, it gets "amount" hit points back.
Attacking and reparing cost 1 energy point each.
Of course, ClapTrap can't do anything if it has no hit points or energy points left.

In all of these member functions, you have to print a message to describe what happens.

For example, the attack() function may display something like (of course, without the angle brackets):

ClapTrap "name" attacks "target", causing "damage" points of damage!

The constructors and destructor must also display a message, so your peer-evaluators
can easily see they have been called.

Implement and turn in your own tests to ensure your code works as expected.
